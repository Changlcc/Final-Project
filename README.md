# Final-Project
%% Preface: 
% This code is to simulate the glucose-responsive GFP-ssrA and RFP-ssrA
% levels in human body. Due to the scope and available time of this 
% project, many trivial parameters are based on reasonable assumptions.
% Those parameters can be chagned according to real reaction mechanisms.
